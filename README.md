### Lab 2

Changing the transition variable in the Animator affects how smoothly and quickly a character switches between animations, which impacts how movement feels in the game. For example, lowering the Transition Duration and disabling Exit Time makes transitions happen almost instantly, creating more responsive controls when the player starts moving. In contrast, longer durations or higher exit times make transitions smoother but can cause delays, making movement feel less immediate.
